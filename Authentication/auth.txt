Auth is categorized in two different categories 

Stateful Auth : 
    Which maintains state or data on server side is Stateful Auth


    Client will request username and password
    in return server will return an unique id this is called session unique id
    server will keep track of that unique id
    whenever again the user requests the server generated id will be provided with that request . Server will then check who that Serverid belongs to
    So it verifies the user using that id 
    After Verifying only then it sends response 

    this id can be provided in cookiees ,response ,headers


    We will Create A AuthMiddleware 
        This MiddleWare will check for the cookie 
    if valid then it will call next 
    else it will reject that 



Stateless:
